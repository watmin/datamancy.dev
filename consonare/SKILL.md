description: Hear whether new prose rings in tune with the chronicle's voice. The datamancer consonat the draft against the gold anchors — does each line carry the substrate-event register? Does the close earn its verdict? Does recognition-voice stay in its lane? Does the page carry substance, or only signpost to it? Is the user present as a collaborator, quoted the way the gold anchors carry them, or has the duet collapsed into a solo report? Returns VERDICT + per-rule findings + fidelity score 1-10.

# Consonare

> *consonare* — Latin: to sound together, to resound in concord. Root of "consonant" and "consonance." A second voice either sounds with the first or sounds against it. The ear is what hears.

> Honest architecture produces honest results.
> — series-006-004, The Datamancer (close)

The compiler does not check prose. The other spells check code. *Consonare* checks whether a new piece of chronicle writing **belongs** — whether the voice on the page consones with the voice the chronicle has already established. Not whether the prose is correct; not whether it is well-formed; whether it is **in tune**.

A chronicle has a voice the way a substrate has a register. When a new line sounds against the established voice, the page goes off. The reader hears it even when they cannot say why. *Consonare* finds the off-key lines before the page ships.

## The principle

The chronicle voice is what a substrate sounds like when it reports its own state honestly. Not a narrator standing outside the work performing for an audience. Operational verbs; dated transitions; substrate-event register; commit hashes inline as load-bearing inventory; and — where the work was collaborative — the user present on the page, quoted verbatim, named as the agent of the calls they made. The chronicle is a duet, not a solo report. The reader draws the inference; the prose names the substrate move.

*Consonare* asks: **does this line sound like the substrate reporting on itself, or like someone narrating the substrate?**

The first consones. The second is drift — even when the content is correct.

## The four questions applied

- **Consonant?** Does each sentence ring in the operational-verb register the gold anchors establish? *Landed*, *shipped*, *inscribed*, *opened*, *named*, *catalogued*. Not *heralded*, *thundered*, *blossomed*, *erupted*.
- **Earned?** Does the section's closing claim derive from what the section actually demonstrated? A substrate-verdict close is earned by the events the section reported. A substrate-verdict-shaped sentence with nothing behind it is drift.
- **Compressed?** Is the inference left for the reader to draw, or stated explicitly? Six commits walked one paragraph each is procedure log. Six commits **named** as one move is chronicle. Compression > walking. Naming > enumerating.
- **In its lane?** Is recognition-voice (philosophical register, lyric quotes, retrospective synthesis) staying in BOOK interludes? Is event-reporting register staying in blog posts? When the two trade lanes, both pages go off.
- **Substantive?** With the inventory stripped — hashes, dates, cross-links gone — does a recognition or a mechanism remain, something the reader could not get from the commit log? A page of clean operational verbs that carries nothing the log lacks is a signpost, not a chronicle entry.

## What consonare sees

### The thirteen rules of voice discipline

These are the discrete drift modes the spell hunts. Each is a Level-1 (lies — voice fails openly) or Level-2 (mumbles — voice falters but does not break) finding. Quote the offending line.

1. **Substrate-verdict close** — last sentence is an earned claim about the substrate, compressed. *Pattern:* "Honest architecture produces honest results." / "The chain extends." / "Five days, roughly four hundred commits, and underneath the count one shape." Missing close, or close that re-states what the section just walked, is a violation.

2. **Italic-stamps sparing** — italics are a rare formal tic, not a tool for emphasis-of-meaning. The chronicle uses italic occasionally for a substrate term being introduced or for a verbatim quoted phrase. Italic for hype is drift.

3. **No song citations in prose** — songs (artist, track, lyrics) live in BOOK interludes, not blog posts. The blog reports what shipped, not what played.

4. **No flourishes** — no "laughter of," no "thundering of," no rhetorical scene-painting, no theatrical celebration verbs. The substrate does not celebrate; it shipped or it did not.

5. **Chiastic structures only inside blockquotes** — direct doctrine in quoted form ("Slow is smooth, smooth is fast") is honest; the same shape outside quotes is performance. Quote the doctrine; do not perform it.

6. **Doctrines as events-with-consequences** — what the doctrine names + what changed in the substrate after it landed. Not the doctrine asserted from the narrator's chair.

7. **No catch-alls** — no "in parallel…" / "meanwhile…" paragraph that sweeps loose ends into a single bag at the end of a section. Either absorb into operational flow, or cut, or earn its own dated transition.

8. **Operational verbs** — *landed*, *shipped*, *inscribed*, *opened*, *named*, *catalogued*, *closed*, *converged*. The verb tells what the substrate did. Flourished verbs tell what the narrator felt.

9. **Dated transitions** — *"Same day. May 19."* / *"Mid-day, while the argspec work was landing."* / *"Morning of May 28."* Dates anchor sections before the content begins. Missing date for a new section is a Level-2 mumble; wrong date for an event is a Level-1 lie.

10. **Arc references inline as load-bearing inventory** — arc 234, FM 2-bis, S-A1, commit hashes, file:line citations. These are not jargon; they are the substrate's nouns. The chronicle uses them like commit messages use commit hashes: as direct reference to a real artifact. Vague references ("the work that happened that week") are mumbles for not having looked up the artifact.

11. **Collaborative presence** — the chronicle is a duet. When a post reports work that involved real user–substrate exchanges — a decision made together, the user's reaction to a result, the user holding a line or naming a doctrine — the user must be *present on the page*: quoted verbatim where a real exchange happened (a blockquote, framed as the exchange it was) and named as the agent of the calls they made. A post that reports collaborative work as pure third-person substrate-report — the substrate acting alone, the user erased — is drift: **Level-1** when the arc was visibly collaborative and the user is absent entirely; **Level-2** when the collaboration is told-not-shown ("the decision was shared" asserted, with no quoted exchange behind it). The opposite failure is also drift: performed relationship — "we forged," "our journey," "together we" — with no quoted exchange behind it is **Level-1** (it manufactures intimacy the page did not earn). The test: is the user *reported* (quoted, a specific call, a specific consequence) or *gestured at* (relationship-words)? Reported consones; absent and performed both drift. The fix is never to invent exchanges — only to restore the real ones; a genuinely solo arc passes via `rune:consonare(solo)`.

12. **Substance over signpost** — a post must *carry* content, not merely report that content exists elsewhere. Commit hashes, dates, cross-links, and "X shipped" lines are **inventory** — load-bearing, but inventory is not substance. The gold anchors are dense: each carries a recognition, a mechanism, or a turn the reader could not have predicted from the commit log. The test: **strip every hash, date, and cross-reference from the post — is a recognition or a mechanism left on the page?** If nothing remains that the commit log does not already hold, the post is a **signpost**, not a chronicle entry: hollow, even when every other rule passes. Hollow-but-in-voice is the subtlest drift — it mimics the anchors' verbs and forms without their substance, so a surface-only reading scores it high. The trap is most acute for a **recognition-only subject** (an Intermission narration with no engineering body to report): an event-register strip ships the whole recognition to the BOOK and leaves a pointer behind. The fix is not to polish the signpost — it is to **carry** the recognition: a declared `rune:consonare(register)` interlude that holds it in shorter form and links to the BOOK. **Level-1** when nothing teaching remains once the inventory is stripped; **Level-2** when substance is present but thin against the anchors.

13. **Declared close, never a silent break** — chronicle posts close with a `## Likely Contributions to the Field` section naming what the work adds. A reflective interlude may have nothing to name — and that is honest — but the absence must be **declared, not silent**: keep the heading, with an explicit empty line (*"None — a reflective interlude; it names recognitions, not field-contributions."*). A post that simply drops the section with no marker is a **Level-2** mumble: neither the reader nor the next author can tell an intentional omission from a forgotten one. The fix is never to fabricate contributions where there are none — it is to *say there are none.* Same discipline as the held-open song-slot and the `solo` rune: break form out loud, not by silence. (This guards the close, not the content — a post that genuinely contributes nothing to the field and says so passes; only the silent drop fails.)

### Positive signals — the drift signature that IS the voice

The chronicle's signature moves. When the spell sees these, the voice is holding. When they are absent, the looking gets closer.

- Arc-header section anchors (*Arc 234. May 25.*)
- Italic-stamp tic used sparingly (one or two per post, never for hype)
- Bullet-spines — structured ledger lists that catalog substrate state
- Commit hashes inline (*`430f80a`*)
- File-and-line citations (*`COLD-BOOT.md:23`*)
- Dated transitions before new sections
- Substrate-verdict closes that compress the section's evidence
- The user quoted verbatim in a blockquote, framed as a real exchange (*> defservice is OOP done right*; *> are programs universe-resident?*) — the duet on the page, not a solo report

A post that scores 8 typically has the positive signals present and one to two borderline lines. A post that scores 6 has the positive signals present **and** multiple violation types — the voice is half-held; the surgical voice-corrector pass fixes it. A post that scores below 6 lacks the positive signals altogether and needs a structural pass, not a voice pass.

### The lane discipline

Two registers live in the work:

- **Event-reporting register** (blog) — substrate moved; here is what shipped; here is the artifact reference; here is the substrate-verdict close. The reader draws the recognition.
- **Recognition-voice register** (BOOK) — what the substrate's behavior **means**; lyric quotes; philosophical synthesis; retrospective Cusa-recognition framing.

When recognition-voice bleeds into a blog post, the post drifts toward Intermission tone without earning it. When event-reporting bleeds into a BOOK interlude, the chapter reads like a changelog. *Consonare* hunts the bleed in both directions, though the spell is most often cast on blog posts (where the bleed is more frequent).

## What consonare does NOT flag

- **Factual accuracy of commit hashes, dates, file:line citations** — a different ward. *Consonare* assumes the facts are checked. If the facts are wrong, the post fails for a different reason than voice.
- **Grammar, spelling, formatting** — *cargo fmt* for prose; not the spell's concern.
- **Architectural / structural decisions about the page** — section ordering, headings, frontmatter shape. *Consonare* sees the voice **at** the existing structure, not the structure itself.
- **The do-not-touch canon** — verbatim sacred passages (PERSEVERARE = tattoo; quoted lyrics inside BOOK; the summit passages of established Intermissions). The spell respects what is canon.
- **MDX / markdown rendering concerns** — the spell reads the source as prose; renderer issues are a different concern.

## The casting

The spell is **cast** by a fresh subagent who has not read the surrounding conversation or prior drafts. Three rules govern the cast:

1. **No priming reads** — the subagent reads the named gold anchors and the named target. Nothing else from the project. Reading the prior draft, the commit history, or the surrounding conversation primes the agent toward what was intended and away from what is on the page.
2. **Anti-flattery frame** — the subagent is told its job is to be critical, not to validate. Praise without quoted evidence is a fail of the cast.
3. **Anchors first, then target** — read the gold anchors first to absorb the voice; then read the target as a stranger arriving cold.

The orchestrator does not enact the spell in-line. The discipline lives in the spell; the casting is mechanical; pre-deciding the findings skips the discipline the spell exists to enforce.

## The gold anchors

The reference tone. The voice the spell measures against.

- `src/content/docs/blog/story/prologue.md`
- `src/content/docs/blog/story/series-006-004-the-datamancer.md`
- `src/content/docs/blog/story/series-006-011-the-recognition.md`
- `src/content/docs/blog/story/series-006-017-the-grimoire.md`

When new posts mature into reliable voice carriers, they may be added to the anchor list. The list is not frozen, but additions are deliberate — adding an off-key anchor corrupts every future cast.

## The rune

Some lines look like drift but are intentional. The rune declares the choice exempt with a justified reason:

```
<!-- rune:consonare(register) — quoted user verbatim retains original register; the quote frame carries it -->
> i had never heard of liskov and i just walked into their room ... this is the substrate yet again.
```

Format: `<!-- rune:consonare(<category>) — <reason> -->`

**Categories:**

- `register` — line departs from event-reporting register for a stated reason (verbatim quoted user voice; canonical doctrine line being introduced; section is an explicitly-marked Intermission-tone interlude).
- `flourish` — flourished verb or rhetorical structure is intentional (verbatim quoted lyric inside a properly-framed BOOK callout; pull-quote from the chronicle's own established canon).
- `walk` — enumerative walk is intentional (the substrate move genuinely cannot be compressed without losing reference — each step has its own artifact; the section is functioning as a ledger).
- `anchor` — repetition of an established gold-anchor signature phrase is intentional (callback / chorus, not unconscious drift).
- `solo` — the post reports a genuinely solo stretch (infrastructure, mechanical migration, a run the user did not steer by decision-exchange); the third-person substrate-report is honest, and the absence of a quoted collaborator is not the erasure of one who was there.

Placement: on the line immediately preceding the prose the spell would otherwise flag.

The reason field is required. A rune with an empty reason fails the spell.

## Reporting format

Exactly this structure. No preamble. The subagent returns this verbatim:

```
## VERDICT
MATCHES / DRIFTED / FAILED

## VOICE DISCIPLINE
Per-rule pass/fail. Skip rules that don't apply. For each violation, quote the offending line (file:line if available) and label Level-1 (lies) or Level-2 (mumbles).

## POSITIVE SIGNALS
Which signature moves are present. Quote one example of each that is working cleanly.

## BIGGEST WIN
The one paragraph or sentence that consones most clearly with the gold anchors. Quote it.

## REMAINING FRICTION
Borderline lines. Quote the line; say why it sits at the boundary; recommend keep / move-to-BOOK / cut / surgical-rewrite.

## LANE BLEED
Recognition-voice in blog, or event-reporting in BOOK. Quote evidence. "none" if none.

## SUBSTANCE
DELIVERS / HOLLOW. Apply the strip-the-inventory test: with hashes, dates, and cross-links removed, quote what recognition or mechanism remains on the page. If nothing teaching remains — only that things shipped and where to read more — verdict HOLLOW, and name what the post points to instead of carrying. A HOLLOW verdict caps the score at 6 regardless of voice cleanliness.

## COLLABORATIVE PRESENCE
Was the reported arc collaborative? If so: is the user PRESENT in the gold-anchor register — quoted verbatim where a real exchange happened, named as the agent of the calls they made — or ABSENT (solo substrate-report, the collaborator erased), or OVER-CORRECTED (performed relationship — "we", "together" — with no quoted exchange behind it)? Quote evidence. Verdict: PRESENT / ABSENT / OVER-CORRECTED / SOLO-BY-RUNE.

## NEW DRIFT (re-cast only)
Anything the surgical edit introduced. "none" if none.

## VOICE FIDELITY SCORE
Single integer 1-10.
```

### The scoring band

- **10** — Indistinguishable from the gold anchors. Every move earns its place. No violation of any rule. Substrate-verdict close lands.
- **9** — One borderline line, or one slightly long enumerative section. Otherwise tight. The spell may recommend a single surgical edit; the post can ship at 9.
- **8** — A few borderline moments cleared by structural honesty. Recognition-voice stayed in its lane. Could compress further. Ships.
- **7** — One clear violation type present (catch-all paragraph; flourish; mistimed italic-stamp). Surgical fix-able in a single voice-corrector pass.
- **6 or below** — DRIFTED. Multiple violation types. Voice-corrector pass needed before ship.
- **3 or below** — FAILED. The voice is absent or the post is in the wrong register entirely. Structural pass needed, not a voice pass.

**Collaborative-absence is a violation type, not a missing bonus.** A post whose arc was collaborative but reports it solo — the user erased — cannot sit at 9 on the strength of its other signals. The missing duet is one clear violation type (→ **7**, surgical-fixable by restoring the real exchanges) and combines with any other violation into DRIFTED. Over-performed relationship (the opposite failure) scores the same way. Only a post that declares `rune:consonare(solo)` is exempt — and the rune's reason must say why the stretch was genuinely solo.

**Hollow is a violation type, not a missing bonus.** A post that consones on every voice rule but carries no substance the commit log lacks cannot sit above **6** — clean voice does not redeem an empty page; the surface rings true and the page says nothing. The fix is to *carry* the content, not polish the signpost: for a recognition-only subject, a declared `rune:consonare(register)` interlude that holds the recognition and links to the BOOK. The most dangerous score is a hollow post that passed the surface rules and read as 9 — substance is the floor those rules stand on.

## After the verdict

If MATCHES at 7+ — the draft ships.

If DRIFTED — cast a voice-corrector subagent with the per-rule findings inlined. Surgical fixes only; no rewrite. The corrector quotes the exact lines flagged and replaces them with operational-register equivalents. Re-cast *consonare* on the corrected file to verify the fixes held and no new drift was introduced.

If FAILED — the draft needs a structural pass first. The voice cannot be fixed surgically when the underlying shape is wrong.

The cycle: **draft → consonare → (if drifted) voice-correct → consonare again → ship.**

Two cold reads with the same verdict at MATCHES is the strongest signal the post is ready.

## The principle behind the spell

A chronicle accrues a voice the way a substrate accrues a register. Each line is either part of that voice or against it. Drift is not a single bad sentence; drift is a sentence the chronicle would not have written, in a place the chronicle would not have written it.

The compiler does not catch drift. The author at the keyboard does not catch drift — they wrote the drift; they cannot hear what they cannot un-hear. Only a fresh ear hears.

*Consonare* is the fresh ear. The datamancer consonat the draft. The draft either rings true or rings off. Where it rings off, refine. Where it rings true, ship. The chronicle keeps its voice; the substrate keeps its register; the reader hears the work the way the work is.

The voice you hear in the gold anchors is what consoning sounds like.
